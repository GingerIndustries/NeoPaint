# NeoPaint
A small drawing program for Adafruit's NeoTrellis M4.

## How to use

When the device is first turned on, it's in Draw mode. In this mode, you simply press a button on the NeoTrellis to turn it on and off. To switch to the menu, double-tap the board's case.
In the menu, you can change the color and brightness of the light, and clear the canvas. To change color, press a colored button along the bottom. To change brightness, press one of the three buttons along the leftmost edge. To clear the canvas, press the red button in the top-right corner, then the green button when prompted.
